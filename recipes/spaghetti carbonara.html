    <h2 class="list">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">100g pancetta</li>
        <li class="list-item">50g pecorino cheese</li>
        <li class="list-item">50g parmesan</li>
        <li class="list-item">3 large eggs</li>
        <li class="list-item">350g spaghetti</li>
        <li class="list-item">2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
        <li class="list-item">50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li class="list-item">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="list">Preparation</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li class="list-item">Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese
             and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper.
             Set everything aside.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the
             boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
        <li class="list-item">Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
        <li class="list-item">While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter
             into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta
              and garlic.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is
             golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted
              spoon and discard.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water
             with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don't worry if a
              little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don't throw the pasta 
              water away yet.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese.
             Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture,
              which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it).
             You don't want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately
             with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish
              does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy
               sauciness will be revived.</li>
